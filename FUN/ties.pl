% It's a Tie by Jenny Roberts (via Google Images of "Dell Logic puzzles"
%
% Four colleagues recently got into a discussion about some of the
% flamboyant patterns showing up on neckties these days. As a joke, each
% man arrived at work the next day sporting the most ridiculous tie he
% could find (no two men wore ties with the same pattern - one tie was
% decorated with smiling cupids). None of the men had to venture outside
% of his own closet, as each had received at least one such tie from a
% different relative! From the following clues, can you match each man
% with the pattern on his flamboyant tie, as well as determine the relative
% who presented each man with his tie?
%
% 1. The tie with the grinning leprechauns wasn't a present from a daughter.
% 2. Mr. Crow's tie features neither the dancing reindeer nor the happy
%    yellow faces.
% 3. Mr. Spiegler's tie wasn't a present from his uncle.
% 4. The tie with the yellow happy faces wasn't a gift from a sister.
% 5. Mr. Evans and Mr. Speigler own the tie with the grinning leprechauns
%    and the tie that was a present from a father-in-law, in some order.
% 6. Mr. Hurley received his flamboyant tie from his sister.
